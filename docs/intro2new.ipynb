See http://www.ehow.com/how_5805520_use-freeze-damage-fruit-trees.html for example which recommends a sprinkler. The \"releases heat\" thing is kind of an oversimplification, but basically as long as you have any liquid water around, it will keep things at zero. The sap of your tree is not pure water, and therefore freezes somewhat below zero. By having the water freeze instead you stay away from the temps that would damage your plants. That said, http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5245655_spraying-frost-protect-fruit-freezing_.html is total gibberish since evaporation doesn't generate heat, quite the opposite.
