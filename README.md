# Information-Retrieval

This project focuses on the study, implementation, and comparison of information retrieval models using the Cystic Fibrosis (C.F) dataset, which consists of 1,209 documents and 100 queries (with a subset of 20 queries provided). The goal is to build and evaluate search engines by applying two key models: the Vector Space Model (VSM) and the colBERT model. The project involves creating an inverted index from the dataset, implementing the VSM with custom term-weighting methods, and applying a pre-trained colBERT model to answer queries. The models are then compared using at least two evaluation metrics to assess their performance. The implementation is done in Python, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of information retrieval systems. This repository contains the code, documentation, and results of the project, providing a comprehensive overview of the process and findings.
